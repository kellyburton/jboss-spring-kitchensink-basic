From the Jboss Site:

Extending the image

To be able to create a management user to access the administration console create a Dockerfile with the following content
FROM quay.io/wildfly/wildfly
RUN /opt/jboss/wildfly/bin/add-user.sh admin Admin#70365 --silent
CMD ["/opt/jboss/wildfly/bin/standalone.sh", "-b", "0.0.0.0", "-bmanagement", "0.0.0.0"]

Then you can build the image:
docker build --tag=jboss/wildfly-admin .

Run it:
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -p9990:9990 jboss/wildfly-admin
Administration console will be available on the port 9990 and 8080  of the container.
